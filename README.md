# Super 2020 Swadge Hardware

This repo contains hardware files for the Super 2020 Barrel and Banana Swadges, as well as the Swadge Programmer and the Swadge Devkit. [KiCad](https://www.kicad-pcb.org/) is used to work with the project files. [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is used to work with the SVG vectors.

The corresponding hardware repository for the Super 2020 Swadge Firmware [can be found here](https://github.com/AEFeinstein/Super-2020-Swadge-FW).

The Barrel and Banana use the same schematic:
